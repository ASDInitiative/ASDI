## Software's Impact Today

It might be easy for most of us to not truly understand the power software has developed throughout its existence. Using our smartphone to connect with someone new on LinkedIn, color correcting a highly-detailed photo, or communicating with a team member over a shareable document might seem like simple tasks our portable computers are able to handle. In reality, these are relatively simple tasks for our devices. However, the fact that the software powering something like an iPhone has more processing power than the software used to launch the Apollo 11 spacecraft is amazing. Software innovation has accelerated in a relatively short amount of time.

Our digital world is becoming more accessible to a larger group of people now. Global satellite coverage for the 5G network is expanding. This is anticipated to give an estimated four-billion people access to a high-speed Internet connection. These newly- opened doors of opportunity are also expected to bring their unique and varivarried economic effects. This software innovation can be thought of negatively since it brings the risk of people losing their jobs due to improved efficiencies, but the reality is there will be new jobs created from people using technology to operate on top a stronger foundation.



## The Challenge
This software transition has not been fluid for everyone, specifically for traditional businesses and lifestyles. Business leaders realize their traditional companies need to adapt into software companies if they hope to thrive. Today’s software is commonly developed at an accelerated level, typically being composed of dense volumes of code. Making certain these millions lines of code are not only correct and functioning properly, but secured and safe from being accessed from unwanted parties, is more paramount today than it was ten years ago.

## Our Current Solutions
In order to meet the speed and security software development demands, developers and leaders have turned their eyes to open source and cloud-based hosting. These hosting solutions decrease the amount of time required for companies or individuals to create and develop software projects since the files are basically made available to those with an Internet connection. Development speeds have been accelerated so much that some projects begin and conclude over a weekend, ultimately giving anyone the ability to develop software at an accelerated pace.

The potential of technological progression contained within software development is auspicious in regards to refining our production efficiency and overall innovative efforts towards a more established and developed futureAutomation has proved to be another solution to the time and security demands software development comes with. Aside from the obvious speed improvements, automation is commonly used to reduce the potential for human error. When reviewing a new digital product, automation is used during software testing. This decreases the amount of human time required to validate and acquire new data and statistics so more of that time can be spent on actual development.

Exciting services like machine learning and artificial intelligence are continually being implemented into software development tools as well. These offer abilities such as real-time code assessments to detect errors and defects early during the development process, saving any time spent addressing these issues post-production.

Though all of these are great solutions for speed, the overall demand for software development skills are not being met as much as we would like. Powerful resources like no-code tools are being utilized to develop and test new software products, opening more doors for those wanting to get into the industry. It should be noted that no-code tools do not serve as the solution we need, but surely warm-welcome assistance to a greater problem we still need to solve.


## Built It
“The only way you can predict the future is to build it” is a famous quote by computer scientist Alan Kay, and it connects very well to accelerated software development and its exciting future. Software is developing at a relatively fast rate and this industry never seems to be stagnant; software trends grow and morph yearly now. The technological revolution we have been waiting for is happening right now. Opportunities to use accelerated software development to create powerful tools and products occur daily; it is our responsibility to not only take advantage of these moments, but to make sure our work is developed in a timely manner, and meets the security demands our world currently has. Utilizing modern services like open source hosting, automation, and machine learning can ensure modern software development not only keeps an accelerated pace but integrates nicely with the world today.
