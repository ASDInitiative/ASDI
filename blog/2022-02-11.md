## A Desire for Acceleration
Innovative business leaders are constantly finding ways to implement new and modern processes into their daily operations. To effectively do this they must understand the impact software can have on their potential business expansion and financial growth. Specifically, in today’s world with the various ways to utilize software, business leaders need to understand how accelerated software development can fill these roles within their business. This is especially important based on business leaders looking for software to be developed within an accelerated time frame to meet the growing needs of their employees and customers.
Employment, wages, as well as research and development are areas directly impacted through accelerated software development. Over three million jobs, solely related to software, have been created within the past few years because of its high-demand. Research and development sectors receive constant funding to reach new breakthroughs in technological improvements, which help companies maintain operations and develop in new ways. This leads to the wages of software developers to typically be higher on average, compared to most occupations within the United States, because of the important problems they solve.

# Software Benefiting the Business
Here are four ways where accelerated software development can positively impact a business’s operations and development:

## Prospect Follow-Ups
Sales professionals are able to quickly, and more efficiently, follow-up with their prospects and existing customers. This can lead to more effective processes for lead-generation, client onboarding, and client check-ins. Users can track current routes, scheduled deliveries, production progress, and other types of data revolving around their business’s performance too.

## Maintaining and Creating Client Relationships
Software can empower business professionals to track how customers find their business, which allows leaders to focus on those successful routes more. Software can help us gain a better understanding of what content and resources users engage the most with. This leads to understanding which website content, for example, drives user engagement, resulting in a more satisfied user experience.

## Quote and Invoice Generation
Software development has positively impacted the development of business practices in the long-run. A majority of the paperwork in the past has been, and continues to be, reduced and stored as digital documents. Furthermore, software allows for more modern ways to complete this documentation efficiently. Marketing material, such as email campaigns, can be composed quickly and sent to a range of prospects and existing clients on a set schedule.


## Success Leaves Clues to Follow
Software continues to be one of the leading factors in business development and success. With software in high-demand to be developed at an accelerated rate, business leaders are turning to those who aim to have innovative, relevant software products developed and made accessible to them. Contrarily, those who choose to neglect the innovations and performance improvements software offers will find themselves struggling to make the changes and impact they desire.
