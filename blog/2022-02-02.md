## Sink or Swim
This year has shown us a glimmer of light by our employers allowing us to gradually return to the office, or at least some of them have. Many companies are now operating through a hybrid method: working in person and/or at home since they have found the majority of their business’s needs can be accomplished remotely. Companies outside of the software industries have undergone a digital integration of technology through various aspects of their businesses. Changes in how they deliver services and products to their customers, process consumer data, and organize their internal structures have been adjusted for the new era we are experiencing. These changes have been done with the intent to generate enough revenue to remain relevant, competitive, and operational. With the need for a new and innovative technological basis, business stability and the overall economy has become dependent on new technological solutions to adapt to these new conditions. With businesses offering more remote and innovative services, how are the life cycles of accelerated software development going to be affected? What about the economic future? Worldwide adaptations such as these have a global, positive, impact and it’s important to understand how these can affect our economy and industry in the time to come.

## Resistance and Development
A transition into this wireless lifestyle has been an ongoing endeavor since the 90’s, but now almost all businesses worldwide have adopted some form of wireless lifestyle during or after 2020. Moreover, having an online presence has been a necessity in this competitive world, but now it has been pushed for more than ever due to the pandemic as businesses were closing left and right for lacking in this area. This has forced businesses to depend on accelerated software development even more, resulting in developers to focus their time and resources on these important, numerous projects that were needed yesterday.

Though there was an initial negative impact on the global economy, a demand for accelerated software development services grew between late 2019 and early 2020, and continued to surge throughout 2020 as low-code development platforms and automation were heavily focused on by numerous industries. Overall, the software development industry had a resistance to COVID and actually grew because of the pandemic. Because business owners decreased manual practices and implemented more strategic technology schemes, existing operations were refined and surprise issues were able to be resolved more quickly because of new, software-based products and tools created. Infamous stay-at-home restrictions exemplified the importance of software-related jobs, and businesses are currently predicted to depend on these services even more in the future.

Overall productivity was observed to have increased along-side the demand for software development professionals. Stay-at-home measures generally showed a positive influence on focus and productivity, positive customer relationships were increased, and general consumer activity grew to reflect the quickly-developed software products meeting and exceeding the rise of new customer needs. Various companies were seen to spend even more on digital advertising due to the pandemic, something we can all expect to continue to see at some degree in the future. Industries such as AR and VR are now projected to provide a large boost to the GDP by the trillions, and other industries such as healthcare and automotive are pursuing new streams of income to further their developing services and technologies.

## An Optimistic Foresight
Though there were obvious caveats to the forced-adjustments we went through, the output of these altered environments has given us many positive aftereffects. Remote work has made collaborations and projects more focused and time efficient. Many organizations are predicted to keep their remote, or semi-remote, working methods in effect to support the safety of their employees, as well as to maintain the positive conditions they have been experiencing. Because of the increased amount of customer requests, a greater need for accelerated software development, and an overall increase in digitized spending, the software industry is forecasted to be very prolific in regards to providing real solutions as well as economic support.
