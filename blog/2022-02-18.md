## Software is Industry
“I think a lot about computing. It is getting embedded in our world. Computing is a core part of every industry. A car is now a computer. Software skills are a valuable resource.” This is a quote taken from Microsoft’s CEO Satya Nadello, one of the business leaders present at the Mobile World Congress gathering in 2019. He was discussing his understanding on what companies should be doing now to be prepared for the future. Many companies have been late to adopt their own software development solutions, which has led them to rely on external software consultant firms to provide cookie-cutter programs. These are weak temporary solutions, not tailored to individual needs or pain points, causing the amount of differentiation between companies to become blurred. To overcome this, companies need to hire software development professionals to devise accelerated solutions which are both unique and direct answers to what is needed.

## Finding the Solution
In the past, common practices of organizations in need of accelerated software development solutions involved outsourcing the work to consultant firms. Sometimes training the majority of their employees to meet these new needs was preferable. These methods might have worked in the past, but today this is not sufficient to properly address the software demands that continue to arise. Disruptions in the digital world are continuing to occur because developing software is sometimes not a part of a company’s backbone.

Thankfully there are numerous software development tools to help make the process easier. Software development tools are programs developed for the creation and support of applications or other software. Like most products, there are free and paid versions of these tools. Codepen, GitHub, and Atom are popular examples of modern developer tools anyone, even big companies, can learn to use for their own projects. To be safe, however, companies in need of software solutions should invest into either individuals with a software engineering background or a company that specializes in accelerated software development. This ensures the final product will be tailored to the specialized needs the company or client might have, limiting the potential for wasted time and resources.


## The Developer’s Role
When collaborating with professionals who specialize in accelerated software development, it is important to realize how to fully utilize their services for your company’s benefit. Software developers are valued as more than just people who throw out code all day. Developers should be involved in brainstorming sessions for potential solutions to a business problem- they are the ones who know how to implement software into the company’s operations. Moreover, developers should be among the individuals who speak and interact with clients. Speaking with clients and hearing their needs empowers developers to produce better solutions since they have such a resourceful one-on-one interaction. Lastly, encourage experimentation to occur throughout the software development life cycle. Experimentation leads to examination, then evaluation, and finally innovation.


## Utilize the Specialized

Companies are reaching out to software development consultant firms to respond to the excessive amount of digital needs their clients demand. However, results are not always optimal and this can cause their production to suffer. To negate the amount of wasted time and resources, companies need to hire professionals focused on accelerated software development made for the individual client. Having teams or groups of software developers who avoid cookie-cutter methods will address the unique disruptions these companies are experiencing. To have a successful development group to rely on, business leaders must adopt a new view towards software developers. Understanding when experimentation would be beneficial, encouraging client-developer interpersonal communication, and having a lot of patience are three ways to make sure your team operates at full capacity. These methods give employees a better understanding of the company’s mission, current goals, and what they need for innovation.
