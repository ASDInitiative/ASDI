# Research & Requirements

## What is the ASDI Requirements Specification?
The ASDI Requirements Specification is a set of practices used to scale the Requirements Engineering phase of a Traditional SDLC down to a short yet comprehensive operation. The goal of this specification is to provide developers and managers with innovative techniques to accelerate the requirements building process.

## Overview
Traditional practices involved in Requirements Engineering (from domain research all the way to SRS/PRD delivery) will be stated over the course of this document.
Each practice will include a name, short description and purpose.

Name : Name of Practice<br />
Short Description : Brief Method of action<br />
Purpose : Purpose of Practice<br />

Alongside each traditional practice, is an alternative (accelerated) approach.
Accelerated approaches fulfill the concepts and goals of traditional practices but are refined to speed up the RE phase.

## Speed VS Accuracy
The Accelerated Software Development Life Cycle and it's practices will not work if the goals of traditional approaches are not met.
Each accelerated approach will have a "proposed" or "approved" tag signifying it's completion of a thorough examination against it's traditional counterpart.

## Statements & Releases
ASDI is open source. All of it's resources are currently free and open to the public. The initiative does not ask for money, however it whole-heartedly welcomes advocates and supporters for accelerated software development life cycles in today's economy. If this is you, please consider joining the community.

ASDI Specifications will be released in increments, with the first available this summer.
